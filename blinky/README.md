###README.md

Based on 'Hello, (Physical) World!' at http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/blinky.html

Make sure you have installed Node, NPM and the Tessel2 driver(s), as explained at [http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/index.html](http://tessel.github.io/t2-start/index.html).

Also, make sure you have installed the Tessel2 Command Line Interpreter (CLI) globally, like so:

```javascript
npm install -g t2-cli
```

Note: If you get the common npm EACCES error, correct it by fixing npm permissions and then running ```npm install -g t2-cli``` again.

To make sure it has been installed successfully, find its version number:

```javascript
npm ts2-cli -v
```

It should give you e.g.: 3.10.10
